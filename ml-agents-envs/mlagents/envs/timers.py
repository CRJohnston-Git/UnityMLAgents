"""
Lightweight, hierarchical timers for profiling sections of code.

Example:

@timed
def foo(t):
    time.sleep(t)

def main():
    for i in range(3):
        foo(i + 1)
    with hierarchical_timer("context"):
        foo(1)

    print(get_timer_tree())

This would produce a timer tree like
    (root)
        "foo"
        "context"
            "foo"

The total time and counts are tracked for each block of code; in this example "foo" and "context.foo" are considered
distinct blocks, and are tracked separately.

The decorator and contextmanager are equivalent; the context manager may be more useful if you want more control
over the timer name, or are splitting up multiple sections of a large function.
