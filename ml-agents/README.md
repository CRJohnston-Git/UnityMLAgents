# Unity ML-Agents Interface and Trainers

The `mlagents` Python package contains two components: The low level API which
allows you to interact directly with a Unity Environment and a training
component which allows you to train Agents in Unity Environments using our
implementations of reinforcement learning or imitation learning.

## Installation

```sh
pip install mlagents
```
