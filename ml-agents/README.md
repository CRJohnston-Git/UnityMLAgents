# Unity ML-Agents Interface and Trainers

The `mlagents` Python package is part of the
[ML-Agents Toolkit](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents).
`mlagents` provides a Python API that allows direct interaction with the Unity
game engine as well as a collection of trainers and algorithms to train agents
in Unity environments.

The `mlagents` Python package contains two components: The low level API which
allows you to interact directly with a Unity Environment and a training
component which allows you to train Agents in Unity Environments using our
implementations of reinforcement learning or imitation learning.

## Installation

Install `mlagents` with:

```sh
pip install mlagents
```
