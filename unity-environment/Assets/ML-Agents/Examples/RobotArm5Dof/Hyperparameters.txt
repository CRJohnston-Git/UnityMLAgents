### General parameters
max_steps = 1.1e7 # Set maximum number of steps to run environment.
run_path = "ppo" # The sub-directory name for model and summary statistics
load_model = True # Whether to load a saved model.
train_model = True # Whether to train the model.
summary_freq = 10000 # Frequency at which to save training statistics.
save_freq = 50000 # Frequency at which to save model.
env_name = "simplerobot-4dof-20" # Name of the training environment file.

### Algorithm-specific parameters for tuning
gamma = 0.99 # Reward discount rate.
lambd = 0.95 # Lambda parameter for GAE.
time_horizon = 150 # How many steps to collect per agent before adding to buffer.
beta = 4e-3 # Strength of entropy regularization
num_epoch = 5 # Number of gradient descent steps per batch of experiences.
epsilon = 0.2 # Acceptable threshold around ratio of old and new policy probabilities.
buffer_size = 20480 # How large the experience buffer should be before gradient descent.
learning_rate = 2e-4 # Model learning rate.
hidden_units = 32 # Number of units in hidden layer.
batch_size = 1024 # How many experiences per gradient descent update step.
