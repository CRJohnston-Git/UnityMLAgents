# Background: TensorFlow

**Work In Progress**

## TensorFlow

[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is a deep learning library.

A few words about TensorFlow and why/how it is relevant would be nice.

TensorFlow is used for training the machine learning models in ML-Agents. 
Unless you are implementing new algorithms, the use of TensorFlow
is mostly abstracted away and behind the scenes. 

## TensorBoard

One component of training models with TensorFlow is setting the
values of certain model attributes (called _hyperparameters_). Finding the
right values of these hyperparameters can require a few iterations.
Consequently, we leverage a visualization tool within TensorFlow called
[TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/summaries_and_tensorboard). 
It allows the visualization of certain agent attributes (e.g. reward)
throughout training which can be helpful in both building
intuitions for the different hyperparameters and setting the optimal values for 
your Unity environment. We provide more details on setting the hyperparameters
in later parts of the documentation, but, in the meantime, if you are 
unfamiliar with TensorBoard we recommend this 
[tutorial](https://github.com/dandelionmane/tf-dev-summit-tensorboard-tutorial).
