# Jupyter

**Work In Progress**

[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) is a fantastic tool for writing code with 
embedded visualizations. We provide several such notebooks for testing your 
Python installation and training behaviors. For a walkthrough of how to use 
Jupyter, see
[Running the Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html)
in the _Jupyter/IPython Quick Start Guide_.

To launch Jupyter, run in the command line:

`jupyter notebook`

Then navigate to `localhost:8888` to access the notebooks.
