Hello! I'm JaAlSaDev!

I'm going through the Software Engineering Immersive course pre-work by General Assembly.

I'm practicing GitHub's workflow, which goes as follows:
	1- Forking
	2- Cloning
	3- Editing
	4- Adding/committing
	5- Pushing
	6- Submitting a pull request

You can ignore or reject my pull request :P.
